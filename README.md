## Introduction

Lisa Pham Taylor's Capstone Project for Ada Developers' Academy Digital Cohort 18.

Soothe is a React Native mobile app for Android and iOS that is connected to a Google Firebase backend for user authentication and data storage. 

Users can sign in with an email and password login authentication. After a prompt, they will be presented cards with different self-care idea suggestions that can be swiped to the right or left of the screen.

Users can also record daily mood and journal entries as well as pull up historical user data, such as which self-care ideas resonated with them on certain days.
